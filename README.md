# ArrowPainter
Paints directions arrows for the terrace of DK0TU for LNDW, given the correct numbers as csv files

Yes, this is not my greatest piece of work. But it runs until it hits the last line of the CSV file, which is an explanation footer, and crashes. PNGs are still generated.

## Prerequisites
Update countries.csv file.

## Build
```
$ cd src
$ javac Arrowpainter.java
```

## Run
```
$ cd src
$ java Arrowpainter
```
